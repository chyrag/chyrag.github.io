          <FONT color=#cccccc size=4> I am M.S.Parashivamurthy, a 
            piscean. Aged 66 years(born on 11th March 1949).
            <P>My grandfather was an artist. When I was a small boy, I used to sit and 
            watch him do oilpaintings on canvas. I wanted to become an artist 
            like him. Since, I was not encouraged to go to any art school, 
            drawing for me remained as hobby only.
            <P>I love Music. I have written some poems in Kannada. I Play 
            Chess with my computer. I love seeing movies filled with love and emotions with 
            lot of tears. I am an introvert and a dreamer.
            <P>I joined the engineering course at NIE, Mysore in 1966 and 
            discontinued it after a year as I was not interested. Then I ran away to 
            Bombay in search of  job in the film industry. I worked as an 
            assistant to the Art Director at Mehboob studios for some time. I could not 
            stay for longer there as I was not strong enough to face the uncertainty. I 
            came back and did my degree in Psychology at Maharaja's college, 
            Mysore. I worked in forest department for three years and then I got 
            a job in Indian Bank, Bangalore. After working for 28 years in the 
            Bank in varous capacities from clerk to branch manager at various places, 
            I took voluntary retirement. Now I am happily spending my time doing things like
            watching TV, reading books, spending time on my personal computer and doing
            painting and drawing.
           <P>In the year 2010, I wrote my first book, an autobiography in kannada called
            'gere daatida mele' published by Roopa prakaashana, Mysore which became quiet popular in literary circle. 
            The very next year I wrote one more book called 'singapurada magala manege', a travelogue.</FONT>
