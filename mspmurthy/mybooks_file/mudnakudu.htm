Dear MSP Murthy

<P>To: mspmurthy  

<P>My friend Naganna spoke to me about reading of a chapter of your 
autobiography. I have also observed certain reviews. 
<p>Your book is  
an example to understand that how a good book can not miss the 
attention of the evaluators or epoch makers. 
<p>I am so happy about 
you and tell others that here is a dalit writer who emerged late 
but strong. All the best to you in your future endeavours.
 
<p>Best wishes,
<BR>mudnakudu
<BR>03 July 2010
