<P><B><U>My comments:</U></B>
  <UL>
   <LI>It is very lucid and page turner in all aspects.

   <LI>It has got the simplicity of first time writer. It is really good, which brings authenticity to the work, what can I say `straight from the heart.’

   <LI>Sometimes while writing an autobiography people tend to glorify their success/failures. I did not see any such glorification in this work. More importantly there is no self pity.
   <LI>Best part which I liked in the book was you never put blame on anybody else.

   <LI>The autobiography is completely personal and that is how it should be.

   <LI>Finally why I liked the book is because I can relate to the book at least 40% to myself!!!
